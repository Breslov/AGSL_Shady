# Shady

![build](https://github.com/drinkthestars/android-template/actions/workflows/android.yml/badge.svg)

Shady is a collection of shaders written in the Android Graphics Shading Language (AGSL), based on Skia's SKSL.
The shaders range widely from fun to functional, and can be used as standalone effects or as a starting points for generative art, visualizations, etc.

It's very WIP ðŸš§

Shaders

Some shaders are ports from [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), or otherwise ported from WebGL/GLSL.
Other shaders were originall written in SKSL, and then slightly tweaked for AGSL.
